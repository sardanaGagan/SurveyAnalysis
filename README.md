# Data Analysis: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Master's Degree in a Hybrid-Learning Environment

## Introduction

This repository presents the findings of a comprehensive data analysis on the topic of pursuing a master's degree in a hybrid-learning environment. The study explores the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid learning from the perspective of students. The project leverages various Microsoft tools, including Microsoft Forms, OneDrive, Power BI, and Power Automate, to streamline the data analysis process, enabling efficient data collection, storage, analysis, and visualization.

### Project Overview

In today's educational landscape, hybrid learning, which combines elements of both in-person and online education, has gained prominence. Many academic institutions offer master's degree programs in this format. To gain insights into the experiences and perceptions of students in hybrid-learning master's programs, we conducted a survey using Microsoft Forms. This survey collected valuable data regarding the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing a master's degree in a hybrid-learning environment.

### Tools Used

The success of this data analysis project is attributed to the effective utilization of several Microsoft tools:

- **Microsoft Forms:** We used Microsoft Forms to design and distribute a structured questionnaire to gather responses from master's degree students. This tool allowed us to collect standardized data efficiently.

- **OneDrive:** All survey responses were securely stored and organized using OneDrive, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

- **Power BI:** Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool, played a pivotal role in transforming raw data into meaningful insights. It facilitated the creation of interactive dashboards, charts, and reports.

- **Power Automate:** Power Automate was employed to automate various data-related tasks, such as data collection, data storage, and notification workflows, streamlining the data analysis process.
